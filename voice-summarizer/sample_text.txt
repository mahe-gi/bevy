Hello, this is a test of our voice summarizer application. Today we discussed the implementation of a complete AI pipeline that converts speech to text, then summarizes the content using artificial intelligence, and finally converts the summary back to speech. This demonstrates the practical application of modern AI technologies including ElevenLabs for speech processing and OpenAI for text summarization. The system works by first transcribing audio files, then generating concise summaries, and finally producing audio output of those summaries.
