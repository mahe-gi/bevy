# ElevenLabs AI Audio Integration

## Overview
This project demonstrates integration with ElevenLabs AI audio services. I have explored and implemented various voice AI capabilities including text-to-speech, speech-to-text, voice cloning, music generation, and speech transformation features.

## What I Learned and Implemented

After going through the ElevenLabs documentation, I implemented the following core services:

1. Text-to-Speech (TTS) - Converting text to natural-sounding speech
2. Speech-to-Text (STT) - Transcribing audio to text with speaker identification  
3. Voice Cloning - Creating custom voice models from audio samples
4. Speech-to-Speech - Voice transformation and conversion
5. Music Generation - AI-powered music composition
6. Voice Isolation - Audio processing and voice extraction

## Technical Implementation

### Dependencies
- @elevenlabs/elevenlabs-js (v2.16.0) - Official ElevenLabs SDK
- dotenv (v17.2.3) - Environment variable management
- ffmpeg (v0.0.4) - Audio processing support

### Key Features Implemented

Text-to-Speech Engine:
- Multi-language support using eleven_multilingual_v2 model
- High-quality audio output in MP3 format (44.1kHz 128kbps)
- Real-time audio playback functionality
- Custom voice ID integration

Speech Recognition System:
- Advanced transcription using scribe_v1 model
- Speaker diarization to identify who is speaking
- Audio event tagging for sounds like laughter and applause
- Multi-language detection and processing

Voice Transformation:
- Speech-to-speech conversion capabilities
- Voice style transfer between different voices
- Real-time voice changing
- Support for multiple audio formats

AI Music Composition:
- Prompt-based music generation
- Customizable duration (tested with 10-second samples)
- Electronic and game music specialization
- Tempo and style control (130-150 BPM range)

Voice Cloning:
- Instant voice cloning from audio samples
- Custom voice model creation
- Voice ID generation for reuse in other applications

## Usage Examples

### Quick Start
```bash
npm install
node textToSpeech.js    # Demo TTS + STT
node musicApi.js        # Generate AI music
node voiceChangerApi.js # Voice transformation
```

### Environment Setup
Create .env file with your ElevenLabs API key:
```
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## What I Accomplished

API Integration - Successfully integrated all major ElevenLabs endpoints
Error Handling - Implemented try-catch blocks for robust error management
Audio Processing - Working with various audio formats and processing
Real-time Playback - Integrated audio playback functionality
Voice Customization - Custom voice creation and cloning capabilities
Documentation Study - Thoroughly explored ElevenLabs API documentation
Modular Code - Separated concerns into individual service files

### Technologies I Worked With
- ElevenLabs JavaScript SDK v2.16.0
- Async/await patterns for audio processing
- Blob handling for audio data
- Environment variable security
- Audio streaming and playback
- Voice AI model parameters and optimization

### Business Applications
- Content Creation: Automated voiceovers and narration
- Accessibility: Text-to-speech for visual impairments
- Localization: Multi-language content generation
- Entertainment: Voice acting and character creation
- Education: Interactive audio learning experiences
- Gaming: Dynamic voice synthesis for characters

## Security Considerations
- API keys properly stored in environment variables
- No hardcoded credentials in source code
- Secure audio file handling and processing

## Demo Content
The implementation includes practical examples:
- "Welcome to Digital Bevy" TTS demo
- High-energy electronic music generation
- Voice conversion using sample audio files
- Transcription of marketing audio content

This demonstrates comprehensive understanding and practical implementation of ElevenLabs AI audio services, ready for production integration into the Bevy platform.
